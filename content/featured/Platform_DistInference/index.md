A scalable forecasting service with FastAPI, Docker and Kubernetes, supporting inference for over 10k time series. Created clustering pipeline using DTW + DBSCAN, improving grouping efficiency by 40% over KMeans, reducing redundant model runs and cutting inference cost by 5Ã— via global model deployment with batched inference using Redis queues.
