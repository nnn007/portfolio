- Optimized Microsoft’s GraphRAG framework for chatbots and text search with custom indexing, reducing latency by 50% and token costs by 90% at a 0.2 accuracy tradeoff for global queries.
- Built a non-LLM Knowledge Graph generator with traversal support which outperformed GraphRAG and LightRAG by ∼2s/10k tokens docs in latency in custom Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) benchmarks using DeepEval.
