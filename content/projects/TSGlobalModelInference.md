Experimented on various approaches for clustering time-series data required for global modelling. Achieved about 40% better clusters on M4 dataset using DTW-based distance and DBSCAN in comparison with vanilla K-Means. Deployed global models like N-BEATS, LightGBM for time-series forecasting which saved 5 times the inference cost.
